# Math Projects

This repository, `math-projects`, is a collection of various mathematical projects and tools that I have developed. These projects span a range of topics in mathematics including combinatorics, probability, and matrix operations.

## Projects

1. **Combinatorics Projects**
   - Located in the `combinatorics-projects` folder.
   - Includes projects that deal with permutations, combinations, and combinatorial optimization problems such as the traveling salesman problem.
   - Each project comes with its individual README for more detailed information.

2. **Probability Projects**
   - Located in the `probability-projects` folder.
   - Encompasses projects that simulate and visualize different probability distributions and their properties.
   - Each project is documented with its respective README.

3. **Cofactor Expansion**
   - Located in the `cofactor-expansion` folder.
   - Consists of tools for matrix operations with a specific focus on cofactor expansion.
   - As with the other projects, this one also includes a README for a comprehensive overview.

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains all the necessary files and documentation to get started. To run a project, navigate to the project's folder and follow the instructions in the project's README.
