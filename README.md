# Cofactor Expansion

A Python script that calculates the determinant of a square matrix using the method of cofactor expansion. The program is designed to handle matrices of any size and will return the determinant of the given matrix.

## Features

- Handles square matrices of any size.
- Calculates determinant using cofactor expansion.
- Includes example matrices for testing.
- Functions `minor` and `determinant` can be imported for external usage.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script with Python 3:

```bash
python3 cofactor-expansion.py
```

Alternatively, you can import the minor and determinant functions for usage in other scripts or projects:

```python
from cofactor_expansion import minor, determinant
```
