# Math Projects

This repository, `math-projects`, is a collection of my various mathematical projects and tools. These projects span a wide range of topics in mathematics. Each project comes with its individual README for more detailed information.

## Projects

1. **Combinatorics Projects**
   - Located in the `combinatorics-projects` folder.
   - Includes projects that deal with permutations, combinations, and combinatorial optimization problems such as the traveling salesman problem.
     
2. **Probability Projects**
   - Located in the `probability-projects` folder.
   - Includes projects that simulate and visualize different probability distributions and their properties.

3. **Cofactor Expansion**
   - Located in the `cofactor-expansion` folder.
   - Includes a script to calculate the determinant of a matrix using cofactor expansion.
  
4. **Topology & Knot Theory Projects**
   - Located in the `topology-knot-theory-projects` folder.
   - Includes a visual representation of a homeomorphism between a sphere and a cube represented in plotly.

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains all the necessary files and documentation to get started. To run a project, navigate to the project's folder and follow the instructions in the project's README. Each folder used to be an individual repo so if you are only interested in a certain project, you can download the individual folder. Enjoy!
